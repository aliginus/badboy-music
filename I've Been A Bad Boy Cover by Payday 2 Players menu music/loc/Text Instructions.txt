In the en.txt you will need to do these steps in order for the mod to successfully function.

You will see this.

"menu_jukebox_" : " ",

"menu_jukebox_screen_ " : " 

Enter whatever you please for these. (Keep it simple) for the both the menu_jukebox and screen, lower case
only and underscores when identifying a space. for example

"menu_jukebox_tutorial"
"menu_jukebox_screen_tutorial" : "

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the exact same thing to the end of the "menu_jukebox_screen_"

In the end quatations where it says "Tutorial" This is where you will see the name in the track in the
settings of Payday 2. Once again, do whatever you please no restrictions.

For example,

"menu_jukebox_tutorial" : "Tutorial",
"menu_jukebox_screen_tutorial" : "Tutorial

These should match with each other.
Once you have completed these steps remember to save and you have finished.
